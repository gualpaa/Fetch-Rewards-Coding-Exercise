1. Reviewing Existing Unstructured Data and Diagraming a New Structured Relational Data Model

   - Reviewed Existing Data
      - I have cleaned and structed three datasets: Users, Brands and Receipts
      - This allowed me to understand the data's orginal unstructured form and organize it.
      - The model includes a clear define of each table listing their fields and primary keys and foreign keys.
      - Users: Contains user account information (creation, last login, active/non)
      - Receipts: contains receipt and transaction data for each user (transaction data, linked to Users through Id)
      - Brands: contains information about the brands that go along with the products (brands that sell products, category) 
      - A user can have multiple receipts which is 1 to many relationships between Users and Receipts
      -
